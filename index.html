      Hi everyone! My name is Bethelehem Engeda and I am currently a high school student in the Bay Area! I have a love for programming and marketing and love to combine both of those as much as I can! I have interned at companies such as Operation HOPE, and have been apart of programs such as Girls Who Code at Amazon in Sunnyvale, CA, as well as part of TechSummer at Facebook where I won their Technical Achievement Award for my original Virtual Reality game. I love to volunteer at my local library as a Teen Tech Volunteer, as well as for an organization called Empower and Excel, where we teach people from underprivileged communities how to code. I am also President of my schools Distributive Educational Club of America (DECA) where I have won top awards in the state of California, as well as being an avid writer as Head Editor of my school’s Newspaper, the Dry Gulch Gazette, where I’ve gotten to speak about issues that I am extremely passionate in!
